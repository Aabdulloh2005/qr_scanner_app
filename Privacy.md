# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: [Date]**

Welcome to the QR Scanner App ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled securely and responsibly. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our QR Scanner App.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Camera Access
Our app requires access to your device's camera to scan QR codes. We do not store or share any images captured through the camera.

### 1.2 Gallery Access
Our app may request access to your device's gallery to allow you to select images containing QR codes. We do not collect or store any images from your gallery.

### 1.3 Storage Access
We use Hive, a local storage solution, to save generated and scanned QR codes on your device. This data is stored locally and is not shared with any external parties.

### 1.4 Sharing Information
Our app uses the `share_plus` package to allow you to share generated or scanned QR codes with others. When you share a QR code, the shared information is handled by your deviceâ€™s native sharing options. We do not store or track any information that you share.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The information collected through camera and gallery access is solely used for the purpose of scanning and generating QR codes. The data stored using Hive is kept on your device for your convenience and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## 3. Data Security

We take your privacy seriously and have implemented measures to ensure the security of the data stored locally on your device. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
